## Infrastructure as Code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (processes, bare-metal servers, virtual servers, etc.) and their configuration through machine-processable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or the use of interactive configuration tools. The definition files may be in a version control system. This has been achieved previously through either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but developments as specifically titled 'IaC' are now focused on the declarative approaches.

## About Ansible
Ansible is an automation engine used for provisioning, configuration management and deployments. Ansible uses an agentless architecture, which means that you don't have to install any additional software on your nodes. To manage your nodes with ansible, you will need a working SSH daemon and Python interpreter.

## Ansible vs Rest of the World
Software | Ansible | Puppet | Chef | Salt
-------- | ------- | ------ | ---- | ----
Language | Python | Ruby | Ruby/Erlang | Python
Agent | No | Yes | Yes  | Yes (not required)
Infrastructure described in | Yaml | Puppet's declarative language | Ruby DSL | Python/JSON/Yaml

## Vagrant environment
Provided Vagrantfile will setup 4 virtual machines (1 manager, 3 managed nodes)
```
192.168.10.2 manager
192.168.10.3 node01
192.168.10.4 node02
192.168.10.5 node03
```

Provisioning scripts will install ansible on manager vm, setup passwordless authentication between manager and nodes and add some entries to hosts file, so you can use domain names and forget about IP addresses.

## Let's play
### Setup
```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh manager
```
On manager:
```
$ ping node01
```
Let's look at the ansible config file (/home/ubuntu/ansible.cfg). It says that our default user on nodes is ubuntu and we want to use sudo to gain more privileges.


### Inventory
Ansible does not know anything about managed nodes, we need to define a file called inventory and put IP addresses/names of our nodes.
Let's call it `hosts`
```
$ vi hosts
```
and put there:
```
node01
node02
node03
```

Now we can check our setup:
```
ansible -i hosts -m ping all
```
and gather some facts about nodes:
```
ansible -i hosts -m setup all
```

### First playbook
Let's create a file called `nginx.yml` and write our first playbook:
```
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: update apt cache
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: install nginx
      apt: name=nginx state=present
```
Now we should be able to execute it on our nodes:
```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx.yml
```

Just to be sure, check if nginx is really working:
```
$ http node01
$ http node02
$ http node03
```
You should be able to see default nginx page, pretty boring, right?

### Templates
Create a directory `templates` and file `index.html.j2`:
```
$ mkdir templates
$ vi templates/index.html.j2
```

```
Hello from {{ansible_hostname}}!
```

then edit our playbook and add another task:
```
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: update apt cache
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: install nginx
      apt: name=nginx state=present

    - name: change index.html
      template: 
        src: index.html.j2 
        dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0755
```
and execute it!
```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx.yml
```
Yay, now our configuration is depending on a variable (remember the gathering facts part?). 

### Ansible Galaxy and roles
Install `DavidWittman.redis` role from Ansible Galaxy
```
$ sudo ansible-galaxy install DavidWittman.redis
```

Rewrite our inventory:
```
$ vi hosts
```
```
[redis-master]
node01

[redis-slave]
node[02:03]
```

Then create a new playbook:
```
$ vi redis.yml
```

```
---
- name: configure the master redis server
  hosts: redis-master
  roles:
    - DavidWittman.redis

- name: configure redis slaves
  hosts: redis-slave
  vars:
    - redis_slaveof: node01 6379
  roles:
    - DavidWittman.redis
```

Our playbook is ready to execute, it will take some time :)
```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts redis.yml
```

All green? Let's test it!

```
vagrant@manager:~$ redis-cli -h node01
node01:6379> set foo bar
OK
node01:6379> get foo
"bar"
node01:6379> 
vagrant@manager:~$ redis-cli -h node02
node02:6379> get foo
"bar"
node02:6379> 
vagrant@manager:~$ redis-cli -h node03
node03:6379> get foo
"bar"
node03:6379> set foo none
(error) READONLY You can't write against a read only slave.
node03:6379> 
```
